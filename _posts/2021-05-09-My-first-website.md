## 2 weeks and I've built a website

So just over two weeks into my journey to becoming a software engineer with Academy Xi and I must tell you, it has been a steep learning curve.

Walking into a change of career path as a 50+ year old is not something you take on lightly, having been forced out of my chosen profession due to health reasons, however, I am pleased to say that it looks like you can teach an old dog new tricks.

To think that if you asked me to build a website 2 weeks ago, I would have gone to Wix and had been lost, yet I've been able to complete, (a fairly basic) website utilizing, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I am pleased with myself and pleased with the people that I have entrusted my education with.

I am happy to report that all this new stuff is sinking in, although I feel as though I'm really struggling with JavaScript and hope it's something that will eventually sink in.

Like I said in a previous chapter, I've been able to create a website from scratch, well not exactly scratch, the basic format was there, I just had to modify pieces here and there until I was happy with what my vision was.

The most important part of building the website, (for me) was to have a well laid out "road map" of what I wanted and then work out what I was going to need to include to get there. So, I started with a clean sheet of A4, (yeah yeah, I'm the O.G here so I still use paper) and listed what I wanted in my website then made a list of the files I would need to make it all happen.

Once I had that together I then tuned to my trusty, Visual Studio Code, (quickly becoming my best friend because I spend so much time with it) and began to add the files I would need and push them up to GitHub.

Once that was done, it was down to some serious coding, first my standard headings for my html, then to my CSS to place the "Master" style for the pages. Seeing as though I'm a newb, I then went about setting each html element then onto its corresponding CSS style so that I wouldn't get to confused.

As I stated previously, JavaScript was a real drama for me, however I was lucky and what little .js I needed was already there, so it was merely a matter of trying to understand what every element was controlling as I placed the code into the file. Although I could understand the basic roadmap of what was going on, I must admit, I was still a little lost, something I hope will improve in time.

All in all I was pretty pleased that I was able to create something that was fairly close to what I had envisioned for myself and look forward to what's next in my journey.

Hope you enjoyed the read, peace out.
